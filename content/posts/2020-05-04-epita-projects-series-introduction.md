This is the first of a long list!

In this series, I'll be writing about the projects I did during my curriculum at
[EPITA](https://www.epita.fr). The posts will briefly describe the projects, and
go on about what they taught me, IT-related or otherwise, and for some of them,
what anyone can learn by doing such project.

This is quite a first for me, I don't expect much of it, but I hope it can bring
me so hindsight about how a project, however small, can teach me.

As I have already been through (almost) 3 years in this school, I will date the
posts at their submission date, however the “last modified” date will be the
date I uploaded the post.
