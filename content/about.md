## Occupations, other than computer stuff

### Music

I’ve been a viola player for the past 14 years. I also played during 4 years
with the [Symphonic Youth Orchestra of
Strasbourg<sup>fr</sup>](https://www.ojssymphonique.net), an associative
orchestra. We went on tour around France, but also in China, Croatia and the
United States.

I also have been learning the guitar on my own for 4 years.

### Prologin

I’ve been a member of the [Prologin](https://prologin.org) organization since
2018. To paraphrase our website, its goal is to introduce young students to the
world of programming and algorithms, by subjecting them to several conventional
problems and exciting challenges.

### BDE

I was the president of the _Bureau Des Étudiants_ (Student Desk) during my first
two years at EPITA. It basically meant organizing events, such as trivia
nights, barbecues, parties…, for the students. It taught me a lot about team
management, treasury, and communication with people.
